Melissa Polonenko

I am an audiologist currently in the PhD program through the Institute of Medical Sciences at UofT. I worked as a clinical audiologist for 3 years in Edmonton, Alberta before going back to school.

My research is conducted at SickKids Hospital in the Cochlear Implant lab. My overarching questions is how children's brains develop with different types of hearing. specifically, how does the auditory system integrate sound that is delivered by an acoustic hearing aid and an electric cochlear implant.

Other than being a grad student, I love to hike, run, play piano and bake.
