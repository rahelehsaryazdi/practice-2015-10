Raheleh Saryazdi
I am a new MA student in the department of Psychology. I am a member of the Language and Action lab.
I study on-line language processing using the eye-tracking technology.
I am also a mother of two beautiful children, ages 8 and 6.
I am honestly too busy to have any hobbies.
I do love watching movies though but right now it is all about the Disney cartoons.
